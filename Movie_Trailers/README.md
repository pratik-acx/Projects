# My Favorite Movie Trailers

This project provides a static HTML page showing some of my favorite movies and plays it trailer when clicked.

## Quick Start

There are two ways to get access to the code:
* [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/pratik-acx/Projects/archive/master.zip).
* Clone the Projects repo and go to Movie trailers folder: `git clone https://github.com/pratik-acx/Projects.git`.

### What's included

Within the download, and in the Movie_Trailers directory, there are the following files:
* media.py
      Contains the Movie class 
* entertainment_center.py
      Contains my favorite movie objects
* fresh_tomatoes.py
      Udacity's code for generating HTML from movie obejct list
* my_movies.html
      HTML page displaying a grid of my favorite movies is generated by running entertainment_center.py
      
## Viewing Favorite movies

There are two ways to view the favorite movies web page:
* The HTML page my_movies.html is generated by running `python entertainment_center.py` and it opens the movie 
  page in the default browser.
* Alternatively, you can also start a HTTP server in Python and have it serve the web page:
  To do that, in Python 3 or greater run `python -m http.server 9000` from the directory you downloaded the movie trailers code.
  In Python 2, you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` to do the same.
  Browse to http://localhost:9000/my_movies.html to view the web page.

Clicking on a movie poster will load the movie trailer in a modal window.
